#Question:3
# Create a tuple containing names of your sisters and your brothers (imaginary siblings are fine)
# Join brothers and sisters tuples and assign it to siblings
# How many siblings do you have?

brothers = ("Prudhvi", "Vasu", "Revanth")    #brothers tuple
sisters = ("Nandini", "Bindhu", "Varsha", "Nidhi")  #sisters tuple
siblings = brothers+sisters                           #siblings tuple by adding
print(f"no of siblings: {len(siblings)}")             #number of siblings
print(siblings)
family_member = ()
family_member += siblings + ("Srinivasa Rao", "Sunitha")  # adding the parents names
print("type: ",type(family_member))
print(f"My family members: {family_member}")
