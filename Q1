#Question 1
# The following is a list of 10 students ages:
# ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
# Sort the list and find the min and max age
# Add the min age and the max age again to the list
# Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
# Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number)
# Find the range of the ages (max minus min)

ages =  [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24] ##creating a list
ages.sort() #sorting
print("sorted list = ", ages)
print(f"minimum age:{min(ages)},maximum age:{max(ages) }") #min and max age
ages.extend([min(ages),max(ages)]) #adding min and max ages
print(f"new list: {ages}") # list after addition
m = int(len(ages)/2) # middle index in the list
print(m)
if m % 2 == 0:   #find if its even or odd
 print(f"The median of ages: {(ages[m-1]  + ages[m])/ 2}") #median age of the ages in the list
print(f"average age is: {sum(ages)/len(ages)}")      #average age in the given list
print(f"Range of the ages: {max(ages) - min(ages)}") # range of ages in the List
