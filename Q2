dog = {} #empty dictionary labled dog
dog = {"name":"jimmy", "color":"White", "bread":"pug", "legs":"4", "age":"2"} #adding key and values

#student dictionary
student= {} 
student= {"first_name":"Divakar","last_name":"Bethamcharla","gender":"male","age":"23","martial status":"single",
           "skills":['Machine Learning'],"country":"India","city":"Hyderabad","address":"Kothagudem"} #adding key and values

print(f"length of student: {len(student)}") # returns the length of student dictionary

print(type(student['skills']))         #prints the value of skills and type of data   

student['skills'].extend(['Python', 'SQL']) #adding two new skills
print(student['skills'])

print(f"keys of student dictionary:{student.keys()}")   #prints the dictionary keys as list
